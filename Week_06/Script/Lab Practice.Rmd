# Introduction 

Today we are going to work with the penguin data to learn R Markdown 

# Load Libraries 
```{r}
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

# Inspect the Data 

```{r}
glimpse(penguins)
```

# Make a plot

plot the penguin data with bill length by bill depth 

```{r}
penguins %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm,
             y = bill_depth_mm,
             color = species)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(x = "Bill Length (mm)",
       y = "Bill Depth (mm)",
       color = "Species") +
  theme_bw()
```
